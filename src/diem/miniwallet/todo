Todo:
* PaymentCommand model instead of general command?
* handle refund with: RefundMetadataV0
* invalid payment command test cases
* test offchain api invalid subaddress
* test wont resubmit txn?

----------done----------
* setup kyc data all fields
* how to setup test app account? configure api?  call create_receive_payment to get onchain address

* txn account_id should be optional ????????? or fail fast?: fail fast, in proxy call it can also fail instead of creating non account id txn
* validate account balance

* validate total account balances?? -- no need for now
* validate server set values not provided?  -- reject


---ignore for now
* add more transaction status to represent offchain command status / actions?
* ReceivePayment generate intent identifier?
* store raw_transaction?
* describe type validation at model?
* test for create transaction account balance in parallel, account balance should always >=0?


---next step:
